# JavaScript Quiz!

Worked through a JavaScript project to put multiple pieces of 
logic together to create a timed Quiz that captures and stores
high scores and functions using a timer and generating lists and
HTML elements with jacaScript.

## Purpose

This project helped me start to work on my pseudocoding and
planning of a small project to put together a working timed
quiz.  This required a basic HTML structure built to hold the 
JavaScript and logic that worked off of the constraints of a
timer and an Array of Objects.
